# healthcare-spending-fiscal-rules
This project started in my last semester of grad school when a mutual friend introduced me to my now co-author H. Christiaan Schakel, who was interested in studying the association between fiscal rules in government budgetary process and the level of healthcare spending in OECD countries.

## part 1 fiscal rules and public healthcare spending
You can find our published paper [Fiscal rules, powerful levers for controlling the health budget?](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1186/s12889-018-5198-y?author_access_token=lOzjNllXItyIbE4XHfC9YG_BpE1tBhCbnbw3BuzI2RMwC__W78PyMdgSluYITE9HEbGIf7pbCd6qEw-l8xfUCgn_pkhYbjFmdct0AXwFgV0vMybY2R9HtPJID_hONfKtKzrqpJ6tlIo4wbeBzMSFMA%3D%3D) Long story short, there is a link between tighter fiscal rules and lower public healthcare spending.

## part 2 fiscal rules and cost shifting
Part two of the study aims to dig deeper into what happens to public healthcare spending when fiscal rules kick in? If the government is not spending as much now, who's taking up the bills? We're developing several matrices to measure who eventually shoulders the burden of healthcare spending.
